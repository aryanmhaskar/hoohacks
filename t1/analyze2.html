              An American woman who had been detained by the Taliban since February has been freed, a source with knowledge of the release told Fox News on Saturday.

              American citizen Faye Hall was released on Thursday and received at the Qatari embassy in Kabul. She has been confirmed to be in good health after undergoing a series of medical checks, the source said. Arrangements are currently underway for her return to the U.S.

              <span style="color: orange;">The Taliban agreed to release Hall after President Donald Trump removed multimillion-dollar bounties on senior members of the militant group, according to a report by the Telegraph.</span>

              The White House shared a video on X Saturday afternoon of Hall thanking the president.

              <span style="color: orange;">"I'm glad you're the President, and thank you for bringing me home," Hall said. "I have never been so proud to be an American citizen. Thank you, Mr. President."</span>

              In a response posted to Truth Social, Trump wrote, "Thank you Faye — So honored with your words!"

              Trump agreed to remove millions of dollars of bounties on three senior members of the Haqqani network, including Sirajuddin Haqqani, the Taliban government’s interior minister, the outlet reported, noting that Washington was offering a $10 million reward for information leading to his capture.

              Fox News Digital wasn't immediately able to confirm the nature of the agreement and has reached out to the White House and the State Department for comment.

              Her release was initiated following a court order and with logistical support from Qatar serving in its role as the United States' protecting power in Afghanistan, the Fox News source said.

              Hall was arrested on Feb. 1 along with a British couple, Peter Reynolds, 79, his wife Barbie, 75, and their interpreter, the outlet reported.

              The Associated Press previously reported that the British couple ran education programs in Afghanistan via Rebuild, an organization that provides education and training programs for businesses, government agencies, educational organizations and nongovernmental groups.

              The Sunday Times said one project was for mothers and children. The Taliban severely restricts women’s education and activities in the country.

              It is unclear what relationship Hall had with the couple or their group.

              The couple’s detention was not based on any violations of local laws or religious customs, but was a political move by a faction to increase international pressure on the government and Haibatullah Akhundzada, its supreme leader, the Telegraph reported.

              The couple’s children wrote a letter to the Taliban pleading for their release, saying that the couple respected and obeyed the laws.

              "They have chosen Afghanistan as their home, rather than with family in England, and they wish to spend the rest of their lives in Afghanistan," the letter reads in part, according to the Associated Press.

              Hall’s release comes after the Taliban released American hostage George Glezmann, 65, last week after holding him for more than two years. That deal was also struck after negotiations between the Trump administration and Qatari officials. Glezmann was abducted while visiting Kabul as a tourist on Dec. 5, 2022.

              <span style="color: orange;">Two other Americans, Ryan Corbett and William McKenty, were released earlier this year in exchange for a Taliban member in U.S. custody in a final-hour deal struck by the Biden administration.</span>

            Mostly accurate. Hall’s release, Qatar’s role, and Trump’s bounty removal are reported by credible sources. The Taliban’s restrictions on women are documented. However, the agreement’s details are unconfirmed by Fox News, adding uncertainty.
